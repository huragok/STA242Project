UC Davis 2015 Spring STA 242 Statistical Programming Project - Visualization

This directory contains the prototype and a flask application for the visualization of the Facebook data for community detection in "Learning to discover social circles in ego networks". A detailed description can be found in the webpages.

To run the flask application one can follow the following steps:
1. Install flask as per http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/
2. Change into directory "./flask".
3. run "python visualization.py" to start a server
4. Open a browser and head over to the url (http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default) and have fun!

We highly recommend using Chrome browser by which the dynamic/interactive visulization requires intensive computation could be better handled.
